The base of this code comes from Rosenstock 2017, which can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lyk7sd6h8459obp/AADxMzMcEDy--K1Odq9rlM97a?dl=0

I developed this work by expanding her code, and, as such, this code reflects the same structure and includes some of the same basic methods as hers.  I try to call these out with in-line comments.

The code was initially adapted to reproduce the results of Weatherall, O'Connor, and Bruner 2018.  That code is not in this repository, but I am happy to send it if you contact me at: mhbergdolt@gmail.com

As of 10/20/23, this code still requires some "clean up" for readability.  Contact me via email if you stumble across this page and need clarification about some function or method.
