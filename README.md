The base of this code comes from Rosenstock 2017, which can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lyk7sd6h8459obp/AADxMzMcEDy--K1Odq9rlM97a?dl=0

I developed this from playing with and expanding her code, and, as such, this code reflects the same structure and includes some of the same basic methods as hers.

The code was initially adapted to reproduce the results of Weatherall, O'Connor, and Bruner 2018.  That code is not in this repository, but I am happy to send it if you contact me at: mhbergdolt@gmail.com

As of 10/20/23, this code still requires some "clean up" for readability.  Contact me via email if you stumble across this page and need clarification about some function or method.
